## Overview

Welcome to the **Context Engineering Intro** repository! This project focuses on context engineering, a method that enhances the capabilities of AI coding assistants. This repository centers around using Claude Code, but the principles apply to any AI coding tool.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of providing relevant information and context to AI coding assistants. By giving the right context, you help the AI understand your needs better. This leads to more accurate code suggestions and solutions.

### Key Concepts

- **Context**: The background information relevant to your coding task.
- **AI Coding Assistants**: Tools like Claude Code that help you write code faster and more efficiently.

## Why Use Context Engineering?

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Context helps the AI provide better code suggestions.
2. **Efficiency**: Spend less time correcting mistakes and more time coding.
3. **Flexibility**: Apply these techniques across different AI coding assistants.

## Getting Started

To start using context engineering, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/backdoorPhish/context-engineering-intro.git
   cd context-engineering-intro
   ```

2. **Download Releases**: Check out the [Releases section](https://github.com/backdoorPhish/context-engineering-intro/releases) for the latest updates and files to download.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This project uses standard libraries, so you may need to install them based on your environment.

## Using Claude Code

Claude Code is a powerful AI coding assistant. To use it effectively, follow these guidelines:

1. **Provide Clear Context**: When you ask for help, include all relevant details.
2. **Iterate**: If the first suggestion isnâ€™t perfect, refine your request with more context.
3. **Experiment**: Try different prompts to see how the AI responds.

### Example Prompts

- **Basic Request**: "Can you help me write a function to calculate the sum of two numbers?"
- **Detailed Request**: "I need a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum. Please include error handling for non-numeric values."

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of context engineering in action:

### Example 1: Simple Function

**Prompt**: "Write a function to check if a number is prime."

**Context**: "Please write it in Python and include comments explaining each step."

**AI Response**:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Example 2: Complex Data Structure

**Prompt**: "Create a class for a library system."

**Context**: "Include methods for adding books, checking out books, and returning books. Use Python."

**AI Response**:
```python
class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = {}
    
    def add_book(self, title, author):
        """Add a book to the library."""
        self.books[title] = author
    
    def checkout_book(self, title):
        """Check out a book from the library."""
        if title in self.books:
            del self.books[title]
            return f"You have checked out {title}."
        return "Book not available."
    
    def return_book(self, title, author):
        """Return a book to the library."""
        self.books[title] = author
        return f"You have returned {title}."
```
